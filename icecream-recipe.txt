Ingredients
- 1 cup white sugar
- 1 cup milk
- 2 eggs
- 2 cups heavy cream
- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice

Directions
1.  In medium saucepan over low heat, stir together sugar, milk and eggs. Cook, stirring continuously, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon, 10 to 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
2.  In a medium bowl, whip cream with electric mixer until soft peaks form. Beat in vanilla and lemon juice, and whip until medium-stiff peaks form. Fold whipped cream into cooled custard. Chill in refrigerator 8 hours or overnight.
3.  Stir chilled mixture to recombine, and freeze in ice cream maker according to manufacturer's instructions.
